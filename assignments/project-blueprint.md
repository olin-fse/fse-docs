## FSE Project Blueprint Guidelines

#### Welcome
Welcome to the FSE Project Blueprint Guidelines. This document should walk you through everything you'll need to know to create a successful blueprint!

#### Sections/Components
At the very minimum, your project blueprint should include the following:
Names
Project abstract
Give us the 10,000 foot view of what you’re trying to accomplish
System architecture
What are the components that will make up the system?
What technologies might you use?
Note: Don’t worry if you don’t feel very confident in your architecture at this point - the whole point of the class is to get you thinking more about these sorts of things!
Design + initial mock-ups
Show us some sketched out paper prototypes of what you imagine the UI might look like (these can and should be pretty tentative at this point)
Documentation plan
How will you show us what you’re working on? 
How will you demonstrate that you’re making progress?
Where can we look to see where you are and where you’re going next?

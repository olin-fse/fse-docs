## FSE Project Blueprint Guidelines

### Welcome

Welcome to the FSE Project Blueprint Guidelines. This document should walk you through everything you'll need to know to create a successful blueprint! After you've read through these guidelines, take a look at our example blueprint for Shawty, the next big name in URL shortening services. //TODO link

#### Submission

To submit, please use this link. //TODO

#### Blueprint Guidelines

At the very minimum, your project blueprint should include the following:

##### Names
Who are you?

##### Project Abstract
Give us the 10,000 foot view of what you’re trying to accomplish.

##### Goals
Think about both your individual and team goals. This is by no means final, but this will help us orient our discussions when meeting with you and discussing 

##### System Architecture
Please answer the following questions:
- What are the major components that will make up the system? How do they interact? (Words/diagram, whatever you see fit)
- What technologies might you use to build these components? Think about languages, frameworks, databases, testing suite, etc. 
    - What are the tradeoffs you're aware of between various options? 
    - What level of familiarity do you have/what would it take to learn them?




System architecture  
What are the components that will make up the system?  
What technologies might you use?  
Note: Don’t worry if you don’t feel very confident in your architecture at this point - the whole point of the class is to get you thinking more about these sorts of things!  
Design + initial mock-ups  
Show us some sketched out paper prototypes of what you imagine the UI might look like \(these can and should be pretty tentative at this point\)  
Documentation plan  
How will you show us what you’re working on?   
How will you demonstrate that you’re making progress?  
Where can we look to see where you are and where you’re going next?

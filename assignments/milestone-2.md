# Milestone 2 - Monday, Mar. 12

* [ ] A `develop` branch that you push to from now on.
* [ ] `master` should be completely clean on Monday - no code whatsoever.
* [ ] A command that will run all backend tests
* [ ] A command that will run all frontend tests
* [ ] A command that will build your frontend code (`npm run build`)
* [ ] Your database configuration extracted out of your source code (e.g. in `db.config.js`). This file should include the URI, username, password, table name, database name, etc (all the info necessary to connect to your database).
* [ ] Everything that is needed to set up your project from scratch (environment variables, `schema.sql`, etc.) should be in BASH scripts and automate-able.

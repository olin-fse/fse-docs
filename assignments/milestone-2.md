# Milestone 2

* [ ] A `develop` branch that you push to from now on.                 
* [ ] A command that will run all backend tests
* [ ] A command that will run all frontend tests
* [ ] A command that will build your frontend code \(`npm run build`\)
* [ ] Your database configuration extracted out of your source code \(e.g. in `db.config.js`\). This file should include the URI, username, password, table name, database name, etc \(all the info necessary to connect to your database\).
* [ ] Two separate profiles set up for your app \(`DEV` and `TEST`\), and it knows what database to connect to for each one \(for example, running `NODE_ENV=TEST npm start` will have your app connect to the test database for end-to-end testing\).
* [ ] All unit, integration, and end-to-end tests running on CI, either on every push to a branch, or on every PR.
* [ ] Everything that is needed to set up your project from scratch \(environment variables, `schema.sql`, etc.\) should be in BASH scripts and automate-able. In other words, to set up your app on a clean Ubuntu environment, you should not need to run anything in the terminal other than `./[name-of-bash-file].sh`.

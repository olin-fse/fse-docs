## Milestone 3

#### Due Thursday, April 19

As we head into the final weeks of class, we'll be covering our last topics. These include:

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) - the final step to fully integrate Docker into our development and deployment workflow

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - a system made for automating container-based deployments

Logging and Monitoring using the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack) \(tentative\)

##### Requirements

We'd like to get everyone to the same point. The requirements are here:

* App deployed to GCP 
* At least one feature \(size doesn't matter\) implemented and pushed to production
* Travis building valid docker images and pushing to Docker Hub on every push to master branch

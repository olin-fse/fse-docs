## Week 0

### Welcome to FSE

Welcome to the first week of FSE! This week will be all about getting the ball rolling for projects. We'll answer such questions as - 'who are you? Who are we? What is FSE?', finalize project ideas, and start working through the process of creating project blueprints.

Most weeks, these daily docs will be filled all sorts of technical nuggets to help you get through the week - tech breakdowns, tutorials, links to external resources, etc.

This week is different. We expect you to spend most of your time working on your project blueprints and getting things set up for the rest of the semester before we jump right into [Unit Testing](/daily-docs/day-1-unit-testing.md) next week.

#### Deliverables

##### Project Blueprint

Complete the [Project Blueprint](/assignments/project-blueprint.md) as described in the specification document. Contact us if you have any questions, feel free to send us drafts and we'll give you some quick feedback.

_Due Date: **Next Thursday, Feb. 1 before class**_

##### Get Shawty Set Up and Running

[Shawty](https://github.com/olin-fse/shawty), the world's next great URL shortener, will serve as our example project throughout the semester. In class, we'll run through demos and examples in Shawty. In class, we'll also set up

_Due date: **Monday, Jan. 29 before class**_

##### Team and Repository GitHub Setup

As we talked about in class today, we're going to attempt the [Olin-FSE GitHub organization](https://github.com/olin-fse) to organize all of our work. Each team will create a team within the organization, and their repository will be hosted within this as well. Don't worry, you'll be able to transfer ownership outside of Olin-FSE at the end of the semester.

_Due date: **Monday, Jan. 29 before class**_

**Hello World**

Create a basic "Hello World" setup using the technologies you've settled on - the point of this is to get a frontend, backend, and database all connected so you can start implementing features and tests next week. 

_Due date: **Wednesday, Jan 31 before class**_

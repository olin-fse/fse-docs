# Week 10 - Docker Compose

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is the final tool we'll be adding to our toolbox to bring our development setup as close as possible to our production environment entirely through Docker and Docker Compose configurations. 

At a high level, all we'll be using Docker Compose for is to automate the creation and linking of all the images/dependencies your app needs to run - the main webserver, database, and other extraneous services \(if you have them\).

Take a look at some of the following links to get started:

* A nice simple worked example to ['Getting Started' with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
* Docker Compose ['Overview' guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)
* Docker Compose [reference page for `docker-compose.yml`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)
* A stackoverflow post about getting your SQL schema to be loaded into the MySQL 

Check this out! We can do fancy things like tabs now.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="First Tab" %}
Look at this wild tab 1 content here.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second Tab" %}
More content in tab two! Wow!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="WOW" %}
When will the madness stop??
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
 As always, let us know if there's a topic you'd like us to cover over the coming weeks.
{% endhint %}

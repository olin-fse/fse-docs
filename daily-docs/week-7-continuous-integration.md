## Week 7

### Continuous Integration

It's happening! This week, we'll be taking some of our first steps outside of testing and towards the world of deployment and automation. Our first stop will be Continuous Integration (CI) - an invaluable tool that will take our testing superpowers to the next level. 

### Schedule

### Deliverables (Due Monday, March 12)

#### Set up Travis CI 
Requirements:
- Set up Travis CI and integrate it with your repository on GitHub
- Develop one small-to-medium sized feature with proper git workflow and show us your progress by next Sunday. We will be looking closely at your commit history on your repository to ensure you're following good practices and not committing directly to master anymore.

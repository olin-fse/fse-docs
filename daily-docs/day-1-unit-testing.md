## Week 1

### Unit Testing

The goals of this week are to:

* Get you familiar with testing frameworks

* Discuss the philosophy behind testing: why we test, and what to test, best practices, and risks

* Be aware that testing is a contentious topic, and sometimes there isnâ€™t a correct answer.

#### Deliverables \(due Monday, Feb. 5 before class\)

##### Coding work

We expect you to:

* Set up a frontend testing framework, with one command to run all tests e.g. `npm test`
* Set up a backend testing framework, with one command to run all tests e.g. `maven test`
* Have at least one unit test for the frontend
* Have at least one unit test for the backend
* Have at least four unit tests total

##### Aside from assignments specific to unit testing, we expect you to continue working on developing your MVP.
